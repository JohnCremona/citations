bib2html et bib2ref

-----------------------------------------------
1. Getting started (on unix/linux)


1.2 Installing the sources

I assume you get a package from the above mentioned ftp site. It is named
bib2html.code.v-XXX.extension where XXX denotes a version number.  The
extension can be either .zip or .tar.gz. Thus running

      % unzip -d     bib2html.code.vXXX.zip
or
      % tar -xvzf bib2html.code.vXXX.tar.gz

should create a directory named bib2html.code.vXXX containing the sources
and some other files.

1.2 Compiling

Go into the  bib2html.code.vXXX directory
      % cd bib2html.code.vXXX
and compile with make (gnumake)
      % make bib2html
      % make bib2ref


The makefile uses gnumake capabilities. if your default make is not gnumake,
please modify the Makefile.mk in the makefiles directory:
      MAKE = gnu-make


1.3 Generating ref file pages from BibTEX files

According that you have installed (copied) bib2ref in some place listed
in your PATH variable, or that you are using the full path toward bib2ref,
you can process your .bib files. While parsing its arguments, bib2ref
considers that all arguments that do not match a command line option are input
files. The following command will then create a ref file from the
BibTEX files given in the command line.

     % bib2ref file1.bib file2.bib ... 

Default output name is ``ref.ref''. You can change this name using the -name option:

     % bib2ref -name toto.ref file1.bib file2.bib ... 


1.4 Generating html pages from BibTEX files

According that you have installed (copied) bib2html in some place listed
in your PATH variable, or that you are using the full path toward bib2html,
you can process your .bib files. While parsing its arguments, bib2html
considers that all arguments that do not match a command line option are input
files. The following command will then create a bundle of html files from the
BibTEX files given in the command line.

     % bib2html file1.bib file2.bib ... 

You may navigate through them using the index.html as starting point.  Notice
the -force option, that will create the needed subdirectories if they do not
exist. 
     % bib2html file1.bib file2.bib ... -force 

Moving the html pages According you like the generated output, you may want to
move it at some more convenient place on your web server storage space. Thus,
     % cp -rp index.html Author Biblio Category Keyword Year DEST/
will copy all the output file in the DEST directory.
