  abstract =	 { In this article a new approach is given for
                  real-time visual tracking of a class of articulated
                  non-rigid objects in 3D. The main contribution of
                  this paper consists in symmetrically modeling the
                  motion and velocity of an articulated object via a
                  novel kinematic set approach. This is likened to a
                  Lagrange-d'Alembert formulation in classical
                  physics. The advantages of this new model over
                  pre-existing methods include improved precision,
                  robustness and efficiency, leading to real-time
                  performance. Furthermore, a general class of
                  mechanical joints can be considered and the method
                  can track objects where previous approaches have
                  failed due to a lack of visual information. In
                  summary, a joint configuration is modeled by using
                  Pfaffian velocity constraints. The configuration and
                  location of a joint is then used to build a general
                  Jacobian Matrix which relates individual rigid body
                  velocities(twists) to an underlying minimal
                  subspace. A closed loop control law is then derived
                  in order to minimize a set of distance errors in the
                  image and estimate the system parameters. The
                  tracking is locally based upon efficient distance
                  criterion. Experimental results show prismatic,
                  rotational and helical type links and up to eight
                  general parameters. A statistical M-estimation
                  technique is applied to improve robustness. A
                  monocular camera system was used as a real-time
                  sensor to verify the theory.},

                  all the degrees of freedom of a robot during the
                  execution of a task. In this paper, a new solution
                  is proposed. The key idea is to divide the global
                  full-constraining task into several subtasks, which
                  can be applied or inactivated to take into account
                  potential constraints of the environment. Far from
                  any constraint, the robot moves according to the
                  full task. When it comes closer to a configuration
                  to avoid, a higher level controller removes one or
                  several subtasks, and activates them again when the
                  constraint is avoided. The last controller ensures
                  the convergence at the global level by introducing
                  some look-ahead capabilities when a local minimum is
                  reached. The robot accomplishes the global task by
                  automatically sequencing sensor-based tasks,
                  obstacle avoidance, and short deliberative
                  phases. In this paper, a complete solution to

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of vision-based navigation and proposes an original control law to perform such navigation. The overall approach is based on an appearance-based representation of the environment, where the scene is directly defined in the sensor space by a database of images acquired during a learning phase. Within this context, a path to follow is described by a set of images, or image path extracted from the database. This image path is designed so as to provide enough information to control the robotic system. The central contribution of this paper is the closed-loop control law that drives the robot to its desired position using this image path. This control does not require either a global 3D reconstruction or a temporal planning step. Furthermore, the robot is not constrained to converge directly upon each image of the path, but chooses its trajectory automatically. We propose a process of qualitative visual servoing, enabling us to enlarge the convergence space towards positioning in a range within a confidence interval. We propose and use specific visual features which ensure that the robot navigates within the visibility path. Experimental simulations are given to show the effectiveness of this method for controlling the motion of a camera in three-dimensional environments (free-flying camera, or camera moving on a plane). In addition, experiments realized with a robotic arm observing a planar scene are also presented.

  abstract =	 { Many computer vision problems such as recognition,
                  image retrieval, and tracking require matching two
                  images. Currently, ones try to find as reliable as
                  possible matching techniques with a very little
                  constraint of computational time. In this paper, we
                  are interested in applying image matching technique
                  into robotic problems such as Augmented Reality,
                  Visual Servoing in which the computational time is a
                  critical element. We propose in this paper a real
                  time keypoint based matching method. The novelties
                  of this method include a fast corner detector, a
                  compact corner descriptor based on Principal
                  Component Analysis (PCA) technique and an efficient
                  matching with help of Approximate Nearest Neighbor
                  (ANN) technique. We show that the method gives a
                  very satisfying result on accuracy as well as the
                  computational time. The matching algorithm is
                  applied to command a robot in a visual servoing
                  application. It works at 10-14Hz and is well robust
                  to variations in 3D viewpoint and illumination.},
