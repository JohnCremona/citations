# citations
List of citations of the LMFDB

The file citations.bib contains BiBTeX references for papers, including preprints, which cite the LMFDB,
either as formal citations or in the text.  The first version of this was obtain from Google Scholar in 2016-04-18 
with some manual editing.

Assuming that you have bibtex2html installed, typing "make" will create two html files, the list of references citations.bib and a linked web page 
of the bibtex entries themselves.
